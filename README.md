# Plagiarism Checker

_This is Simple project for checking plagiarism of text documents using cosine similarity_

_Cosine Similarity_:
```
    Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them.
```

On Demo we have used three textfiles on the
same directory with app.py , once we run the app
it will open all textfile and tries to find the
similarities between them by using cosine similarity 

```
I used scikit-learn to computer the cosine similarity
```

```
Run the file using below command
python3 app.py
```
